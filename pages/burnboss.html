            <strong>Description:</strong>A workout app designed to give freedom to the users, by allowing them to build and customise workouts. </br>
            I built BurnBoss for my A-level Computer Science project, where I achieved full marks for the <a href="../assets/files/BurnBoss Write-up.pdf">write-up</a>.

        <h2>Changelog:</h2>
        <p>Note: This changelog has only started <strong>after</strong> I had finished the project for my A-level. </p>
        <p>Only the last 5 minor version changes (+ the first release) will be available to download.</p>
        <h4>Post-A-level - 28/02/2024 - v1.0.0</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Major - This is what I considered to be "enough" to finish my project with. It has functionality to create, edit and play workouts, but nothing more. Unfortunately it is also riddled with bugs and missing plenty of features.</li>
            <li> Features:
                <ul>
                    <li>You can now create workouts! They can be filled with activities.</li>
                    <li>You can edit previously created workouts, with the ability to change the name and the contents of any activities.</li>
                    <li>Workouts can be selected from and played/ran.</li>
                </ul>
